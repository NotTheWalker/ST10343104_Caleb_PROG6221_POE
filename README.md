### 2. Clone the Repository:

` git clone https://github.com/NotTheWalker/ST10343104_Caleb_PROG6221_POE.git `

### 3. Navigate to the Directory:

Use this command to ensure you are in the correct folder:

### 4. Build the Application:

Using `dotnet build`

### 5. Run it!
Using `dotnet run`

## Usage
The aplication opens onto the main menu. There you can add, view, or exit.
You will have to create a recipe before you can view it.

Simply follow the prompts that will appear on screen. 
When prompted for input, always enter menu number adjacent to the desired input. 
When asked for numbers, ensure you enter valid input, as not doing so may lose your current progress, or worse; crash the application. This is especially true while selecting menu options. For example:
```
Welcome to the Recipe Manager!
What would you like to do?
1. Add a recipe
2. View a recipe
3. Exit
```
For your input, **only** supply the digit of the menu item, such as `1`
Do not enter the proceeding full stop, or the menu text, such as `1. Add a recipe`

## Exiting
Use option 3 from the main menu to exit naturally.
Please note: Your recipe will not be saved between sessions.
